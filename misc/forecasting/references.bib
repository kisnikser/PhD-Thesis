@article{BAUDENDISTEL1995701,
	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is usually based on acquisition of alternating series of images under rest and an activation task (stimulus). Brain activation maps can be generated from fMRI data sets by applying several mathematical methods. Two methods of image postprocessing have been compared: (i) simple difference of mean values between rest and stimulation, and (ii) Student's t-test. The comparison shows that the difference method is very sensitive to arbitrary signal fluctuations as seen mainly in large vessels (e.g., in the sagittal sinus), leading to insignificantly activated spots in brain activation maps. In contrary, Student's t-test maps show strongly reduced sensitivity for fluctuations and have the advantage of giving activation thresholds by setting significance levels. This allows the comparison of activation strength between patient collectives by using a grid overlay technique leading to an observer independent quantification of the stimulation effects. The method was able to reproduce previous findings of activation differences between healthy volunteers and schizophrenic patients. Moreover, a simple algorithm for the correction of slight head movements during the functional imaging task is presented. The algorithm is based on shifting the fMRI data set relative to a reference image by maximizing the linear correlation coefficients. This leads to a further reduction of insignificant brain activation and to an improvement in brain activation map quality.},

Initial fMRI studies identified visual, somatosensory, auditory and motor activation areas in the primary cortices. Current `second generation' studies aim to identify changes in the fMRI signal associated with specific tasks and stimulus parameters. Dynamic aspects of brain processing for performing higher order cognitive functions, such as language, attention, mental imagery, and learning and memory, have also been explored.},

	abstract = {In this article we describe clinical applications of functional MRI (fMRI) at 1.0 T. All experiments were performed on a commercially available 1.0-T system (Magnetom Impact Expert, Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany) using a blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)-sensitive multi-slice EPI technique (TE 66 ms, 4 mm slice thickness, 210 mm field of view, 64 ×64 acquisition matrix). Different paradigms for localization of the motor cortex and for language lateralization were tested in healthy subjects and patients. Methodological considerations concerning the development of the paradigms are also described. In all healthy subjects, motor activation elicited BOLD signal changes in the sensorimotor cortex, permitting identification of primary motor and sensory cortical areas. Furthermore, focal activation of different cortical areas by a language task was possible in 6 of 10 subjects. Nineteen motor studies were performed in 18 patients with supratentorial lesions, in most cases prior to neurosurgical procedures. In 14 studies, fMRI results demonstrated the localization of the motor hand areas relative to the lesion. The results proved valuable for preoperative planning and contributed to therapeutical decisions. We conclude that functional MRI for clinically relevant applications, such as localization of motor and language function, is feasible even at a field strength of 1.0 T without dedicated equipment.},

To correlate each type of activation with the histologic characteristics of each tumor. Materials and Methods: fMRI was performed in 17 patients (14 adults and 3 children), without any motor deficit, presenting with various intracerebral tumors. Three fMRI activation paradigms were used: contralateral to the lesion: ballistic opposition of the fingers, flexion-extension of the foot and click of the tongue. Four patients, without motor deficit, with cerebral tumors far from the motor homunculus were used as control group to look for nonspecific activations. In all cases, the histopathology of the tumor was known accurately. Results: In 11 patients with infiltrating tumors, the activated areas were clearly displaced. They were often intratumoral and scattered in correlation with the degree of infiltration. Two patients with noninfiltrating tumors (meningioma) showed extratumoral shift of the activated areas. Four patients presenting cerebral tumors far from the homunculus motor did not show intratumoral actiyation. The supplementary motor area and the ipsilateral primary motor cortex were also reproducibly activated during the motor tasks. The task of the tongue was often artifacted, probably because of the head motion. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that the histopathologic characteristics of a tumor, and especially its microscopic structure, play a role in the organization of the motor functional area. In a small number of cases, fMRI could be used intraoperatively with a neuronavigation system.}",
